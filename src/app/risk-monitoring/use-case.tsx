    title: "Transaction Limitation and Restrictions",
    description: "When a customer or transaction is deemed high-risk by the system, certain restrictions may be imposed, including transaction limitations and restricted access to specific features. The extent of these limitations will be determined by the institution's internal policies, regulatory obligations, and risk tolerance framework. A predefined set of risk thresholds will be established to assess and categorize potential threats, ensuring proactive risk mitigation. These thresholds are fully customizable and can be adjusted dynamically to align with the institutionâ€™s evolving security protocols, compliance requirements, and operational needs.",
